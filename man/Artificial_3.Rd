\title{Artificial data set to demonstrate possible instabilities}
\format{An object of class \code{data.frame} with 4 rows and 4 columns.}
\usage{
Artificial_3
}
\description{
This is a simple data set based on three lists, which shows that there is not necessarily any clear hierarchical
 relationship between models that fail on one or the other of the criteria tested by \code{\link{checkident}}.
}
\details{
If all three interactions are included in the fitted model then then the linear program
in \code{\link{checkident}} yields a strictly positive value but the matrix A is not of full column rank, so the parameters are not identifiable.
If the model contains AB either alone or in conjunction with one of AC and BC, then the linear program result is zero, so the MLE does not exist.
If only main effects are considered, or if either or both of AC and BC, but not AB are included,
then the model passes both tests.
