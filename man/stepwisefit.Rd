\title{Stepwise fit using Poisson p-values.}
\usage{
stepwisefit(zdat, pthresh = 0.02)
}
\arguments{
\item{zdat}{Data matrix with \eqn{t+1} columns. The first \eqn{t} columns, each corresponding to a particular list,
are 0s and 1s defining the capture histories
observed. The last column is the count of cases with that particular capture history.
List names A, B, ... are constructed if not supplied. Where a capture history is not explicitly listed,
it is assumed that it has zero count.}

\item{pthresh}{this is the threshold below which the p-value of the newly added parameter needs to be in order to be included in the model.
If \code{pthresh = 0} then the model with main effects only is returned.}
}
\value{
A list with components as below

\code{fit} Details of the fit of the specified model as output by \code{glm}.  The Akaike information criterion is adjusted to take account
  of the number of parameters corresponding to non-overlapping pairs.

\code{emptyoverlaps} Matrix with two rows, giving the list pairs within the model for which no cases are observed in common.
  Each column gives the indices of a pair of lists, with the names of the lists in the column name.

\code{poisspempty} the Poisson p-values of the parameters corresponding to non-overlapping pairs.
}
\description{
Starting with a model with main effects only, two-list parameters are added one by one.
At each stage the parameter with the lowest p-value is added, provided that p-value is lower than \code{pthresh}, and provided that the resulting
model does not fail either of the tests in \code{\link{checkident}}.
}
\details{
For each candidate two-list parameter for possible addition to the model, the p-value is calculated as follows.
The total of cases occurring on both lists indexed by the parameter (regardless of
whether or not they are on any other lists) is calculated.
On the null hypothesis that the effect is not included in the model, this statistic has a Poisson
distribution whose mean depends on the parameters within the model.    The one-sided Poisson p-value of the observed statistic is calculated.
